# Mathematical Pendulum Simulation

This project was created as part of the *Foundations of Computer Simulations (PSM)* course at **PJATK**.  
It models the motion of a simple pendulum using two numerical integration methods and analyzes the system’s energy.

## Project Description
A Python program that simulates a simple pendulum with:  
- **Improved Euler Method (Heun’s Method)**  
- **Runge–Kutta 4th Order Method (RK4)**  

The simulation compares angular displacement and energy conservation between the two methods.  
It also computes and plots potential, kinetic, and total energy over time.

## Usage
```bash
python pendulum_simulation.py
