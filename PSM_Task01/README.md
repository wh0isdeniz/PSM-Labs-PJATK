# Taylor Series Sine Approximation

This project was created as the **1st assignment** for the *Foundations of Computer Simulations (PSM)* course at **PJATK**.  
It received a **perfect grade (10/10)** and is shared here for informational purposes.

## Project Description
A Java program that approximates `sin(x)` using the Taylor series expansion around zero (Maclaurin series).  
The program takes an angle as input and calculates the sine value by summing a finite number of terms.  
This illustrates how mathematical series can be applied to numerical computation and simulations.

## Usage
```bash
javac TaylorSeriesSin.java
java TaylorSeriesSin
